# ColorEditorForParaview
I wanted to fine tune my Paraview B&amp;W scheme to increase the resolution in certain areas of my data range but the 'Color transfer values' dialog box is pretty crap for this purpose. Anyway this is a very simple (rather scruffy) python code that someone out there may find useful!!
